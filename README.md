# Machine Learning Learning Resources

## Fundamentals

These are not pre-requisites; they are the theoretical background for all the rest.

- Linear algebra
    - [Gilbert Strang / Linear Algebra 18.06 / MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/)
- Machine learning
    - [Hastie and Tibshirani / Statistical Learning / Stanford](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about): non deep ML â€“ k-means, linear and logistic regression, decision trees, boosting, cross validation, etc.
    - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (the textbook that goes with the above)
- Information theory
    - [David MacKay / Information Theory, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCiZc0n6COY): capacity of a noisy channel, Bayesian inference, clustering
- Bayesian inference
    - [D Sivia, J Skilling / Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Bayesian-Devinderjit-Sivia/dp/0198568320) (textbook)
- Deep learning
    - [Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville / Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) (textbook)

## Neural Networks

- [Andrew Ng / Machine Learning / Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning): regression, linear algebra review, fully connected neural networks, unsupervised learning, anomaly detection; in Octave / Matlab (maybe skip right to CS231n)
- [Li, Karpathy, Johnson / CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition 2016 / Stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2016/): convolutional nets, LSTMs; very detailed, in python / numpy
- [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/): hands-on courses and forum

## Reinforcement Learning

- [David Silver / Introduction to Reinforcement Learning / UCL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0): value iteration, policy iteration, Q learning, Monte Carlo tree search
- Deep RL bootcamp
- udacity Deep RL nanodegree

## Papers

- [Arxiv Sanity Preserver](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/): paper recommender system

## Curriculum

This is really up to you, but as a first stab I'd suggest:

1. Hastie and Tibshirani / Statistical Learning
2. CS231n (might be hard, try Andrew Ng's Coursera course for a gentler intro)
3. David Silver / Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
4. fast.ai (start here if you want to dive right in)
5. Start building your own thing / go back and fill in gaps in your understanding / dive into the literature
